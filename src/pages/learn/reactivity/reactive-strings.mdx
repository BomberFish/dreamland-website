# Reactive strings

### Note

> This requires the `usestring` feature to be enabled in your build of dreamland. See the [Building Dreamland](/learn/introduction/building-dreamland) page for more information.


You use the `use` function to create a pointer to a template string, which updates when variables within it change.

```jsx
<div>
	<input placeholder={use`Hello, ${this.name}!`} />
</div>
```

This is useful for properties on elements that need to be recalculated
