# CSS-in-JS

### Note

> This requires the `css` feature to be enabled in your build of dreamland. See the [Building Dreamland](/learn/introduction/building-dreamland) page for more information.

With the css feature, dreamland comes built in with an optional CSS-in-js solution, making a lot of things easier. This is provided through the `css` function, which returns a class name. Here's an example:

## CSS tag function

In this example, the CSS attributes "color: green" and "background-color: yellow" will get applied to the root `<div>` that has the `class=${styles}`. The `.button` selector will apply to any child of the element with the ".button" class, but will not affect elements in the rest of the page that also have that class
<Code>
```js
let styles = css`
	color: green;
	background-color: yellow;

	.button {
		color: red;
		background-color: blue;
	}
`;

let element = html`
	<div class=${styles}>
		Hello, world!
		<button class="button">Click me!</button>
	</div>
`;
```
```jsx
let styles = css`
	color: green;
	background-color: yellow;

	.button {
		color: red;
		background-color: blue;
	}
`;

let element = (
	<div class={styles}>
		Hello, world!
		<button class="button">Click me!</button>
	</div>
);
```
</Code>

## Component-scoped-CSS
The CSS here will act mostly similar to the above example, but **unlike** the previous example, when CSS is applied to a component it will only have effect within the boundary of the component. If another component that contains a button is added as a child of this component, the button selector will not leak out of our `App` component
<Code>
```js
function App(){
	this.css = `
		color: green;
		background-color: yellow;

		button {
			color: red;
			background-color: blue;
		}
	`;

	return html`
		<div>
			Hello, world!
			<button>Click me!</button>
		</div>
	`;
};
```
```jsx
function App(){
	this.css = css`
		color: green;
		background-color: yellow;

		button {
			color: red;
			background-color: blue;
		}
	`;

	return (
		<div>
			Hello, world!
			<button>Click me!</button>
		</div>
	);
};
```
</Code>




Small notice, for now avoid writing CSS that doesn't use proper newlines:
```js
let styles = css`
	background-color: green;

	a { color: green }
	button { margin: 0; }
`
```
CSS formatted in this way may cause issues with the current system
