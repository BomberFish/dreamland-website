# Basic HTML


In dreamland, everything is an HTML element. Unlike other frameworks, we don't abstract away the DOM, only make it easier to use. Let's create an HTML element right now.

<Code>
```js
let button = html`<button class="some-button">content here!</button>`;
document.body.appendChild(button);
```
```jsx
let button = <button class="some-button">content here!</button>;
document.body.appendChild(button);
```
</Code>

We just created a button, with the class "some-button", and added it to the document. This is the simplest possible way of using dreamland, and is why it's so easy to slowly transition to using it from a plain-js codebase.

> Note: If you are coming from react, you may be used to using `className` instead of `class`. In dreamland, we use `class` to match the standard HTML attribute.

### Extra (syntax) Sugar!

What if we wanted to do something when the button is clicked? For any DOM event, you can use `on:` handlers.


<Code>
```js
let button = (
	html`<button class="some-button" on:click=${() => alert("button clicked!")}>
		click me!
	</button>`
);
```
```jsx
let button = (
	<button class="some-button" on:click={() => alert("button clicked!")}>
		click me!
	</button>
);
```
</Code>
