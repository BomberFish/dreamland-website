# Introduction

## Why do I want dreamland.js?

Chances are, you might not. How we should render and update HTML on a website is a holy-war level question with countless solutions, [some good](https://svelte.dev/), [some bad](https://htmx.org/). We don't have a filled-out ecosystem, and might not prove to scale well. But if you agree with the following, dreamland.js might just be the best framework to write your next web project in.

## Design Philosophy

- You should be able to use as little or as much of the framework as you want to
- You should not have to subscribe to any specific build tool, or any build tool at all
- Abstractions must be optional. Everything should be an HTML element at the end of the day, with normal HTML behavior
- The framework should be **modular**, and not present a burden to the rest of the project
- virtual-dom is bloat

dreamland.js is an absurdly minimal, opt-in approach for creating **working** declarative UI that reacts to state without the hassle.
