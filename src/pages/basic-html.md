# Basic HTML

> ### Note
>
> For the purposes of easy documentation, all examples will be written with JSX syntax, which is not supported in the JavaScript standard and must be used with a preprocessor such as tsc, esbuild, Babel, etc. This is entirely optional, and the `html` tag function is provided to allow for use without a preprocessor:
>
> ```js
> return (
> 	html`<button on:click=${() => this.counter++}>I have been clicked ${use(this.counter)} times!</button>`;
> )
> ```
>
> Whereas the equivalent JSX would look like
>
> ```jsx
> return (
> 	<button on:click={() => this.counter++}>I have been clicked {use(this.counter)} times!</button>;
> );
> ```
>
> Which one you choose to use comes down to personal preference, but remember that all examples shown with JSX work in plain JavaScript.

In dreamland, everything is an HTML element. We try to abstract the DOM, but never replace it.

Let's create an HTML element right now.

```jsx
let button = <button class="some-button">content here!</button>;
document.body.appendChild(button);
```

We just created a button, with the class "some-button", and added it to the document. This is the simplest possible way of using dreamland, and is why it's so easy to slowly transition to using it from a plain-js codebase.

> Note: If you are coming from react, you may be used to using `className` instead of `class`. In dreamland, we use `class` to match the standard HTML attribute.

### Extra (syntax) Sugar!

What if we wanted to do something when the button is clicked? For any DOM event, you can use `on:` handlers.

```jsx
let button = (
	<button class="some-button" on:click={() => alert("button clicked!")}>
		click me!
	</button>
);
```
